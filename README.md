# Logisim 1 Kilobyte Memory

This was originally a 12-bit address 4 Kilobyte memory but it wouldn't load and would crash my Logisim. I had to cut it down from 8x8x64 to 4x4x64 to get it to load. I built this during my quest to simulate the MARIE (Machine Architecture that is Really Intuitive and Easy) architecture in Logisim. I didn't think that Logisim would have this bad of a performance. I'm just going to use Logisim's built-in RAM for the rest of building MARIE. maybe one day I'll make a better circuit simulator in Rust.
